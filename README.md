# Freeing-Light
A game made in unity. The game is lava parkour with 3 types of platforms that each move different. The game also hosts a start and end menu and a custom lava shader.

# References
The objects, lava, and code are my creations but the sky texture, rock texture, and sounds do not belong to me.
